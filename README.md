# README for Spaceship Titanic Prediction Challenge

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Spaceship Titanic** prediction challenge! This competition tasks you with predicting whether passengers aboard the ill-fated interstellar vessel Spaceship Titanic were transported to another dimension following a collision with a spacetime anomaly.

Your goal is to use machine learning to analyze the provided training dataset and predict the `Transported` status for passengers in the test dataset.

---

## Files Provided

### 1. `train.csv`
This file contains personal and voyage data for approximately two-thirds (~8700) of the passengers. The key columns include:
- **PassengerId**: Unique ID in the format `gggg_pp` (group and position within the group).
- **HomePlanet**: Departure planet.
- **CryoSleep**: Boolean indicating suspended animation status.
- **Cabin**: Cabin details formatted as `deck/num/side`.
- **Destination**: Debarkation planet.
- **Age**: Age of the passenger.
- **VIP**: Boolean indicating VIP service.
- **RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck**: Bills incurred at various amenities.
- **Name**: Full name of the passenger.
- **Transported**: Target column (True/False) indicating if the passenger was transported to another dimension.

### 2. `test.csv`
This file contains similar data for the remaining one-third (~4300) of the passengers. Your task is to predict the `Transported` status for this dataset.

### 3. `sample_submission.csv`
A template submission file showing the correct format for your predictions:
- **PassengerId**: Unique ID matching the test dataset.
- **Transported**: Your prediction (True/False).

---

## Submission Format

Submit a CSV file with two columns:
- **PassengerId**: IDs from the test dataset.
- **Transported**: Predicted values for the target variable (`True` or `False`).

Example:
```csv
PassengerId,Transported
0013_01,False
0018_01,False
0019_01,False
0021_01,False
```

## Evaluation Metric

Submissions are evaluated on **classification accuracy**, which is the percentage of correctly predicted labels.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Explore the Data**:
   - Examine the relationships between features like `HomePlanet`, `CryoSleep`, and billing columns (`RoomService`, `FoodCourt`, etc.) with the target variable `Transported`.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Parse features such as `Cabin` into meaningful components (e.g., `deck`, `side`).
   - Handle missing data effectively.

3. **Modeling**:
   - Start with simple models (e.g., Logistic Regression).
   - Experiment with advanced techniques like ensemble models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.).

4. **Validation**:
   - Use techniques like cross-validation to evaluate your model.

5. **Submission**:
   - Ensure your submission adheres to the required format.
